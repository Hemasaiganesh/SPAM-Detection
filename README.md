# 📧 Spam Detection using Machine Learning
This project implements a **Spam Message Classifier** that predicts whether a message is **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using NLP techniques and various Machine Learning algorithms.
---
## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of SMS text messages (stopword removal, punctuation removal, etc.)
- Data visualization with **WordClouds**
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- Model training with multiple classifiers:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - XGBoost
- Achieved accuracy of **~98%** with **Naive Bayes**
- Model saved using **Joblib** for future predictions
---
## 📂 Dataset
The project uses the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** (`spam.csv`), which contains:
- **Ham messages:** 4825  
- **Spam messages:** 747  
- Total: **5572 messages**
